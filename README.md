backstage is a custom music collection organizer that I created (mainly) back in 2010 for a project group when I went to high school. The pupils of the project group -- [antenneSIBI](http://www.sibi-honnef.de/index.php/antennesibi.html) -- drive an amateur radio station at important events (for the school) with an own VHF frequency at 97.1 MHz. 

It can keep track of the state of studio items (e.g. microphones, recorders) and manage renting them out and it organize music files and music CD's to store custom informations which are important for moderation (e.g. ramp times). It also allows to export the data to lists or print stickers with barcodes to easily identify CDs if they have been populated in backstage.

*Attention!* This software has been discontinued and there is no further development (currently). But it might serve educational purposes.

# Download

A downloadable version (most recent from 2010) of backstage can be found [here (in `dist/bs.jar`)](/dist/bs.jar?raw=true). Make sure that you also get the `dist/lib` folder with the JAR file in the same directory since it contains all necessary libraries used by backstage.

The folder `backstage-0.2-alpha` contains a demo of the previous version of backstage which looks quite different.

The project has been developed with NetBeans 8.1 IDE and can be directly opened with it.
